**Real-Time Tracking Application**  
This project is a real-time tracking application built with **Node.js**, **Socket.IO**, and **Leaflet.js**.
It uses the Geolocation API to capture and transmit user locations, displaying them dynamically on an interactive map. 

Key features include:  

- Real-time location updates using WebSocket technology.  
- Interactive map visualization with dynamic marker management.  
- Efficient backend handling of user connections and geolocation data.  

This application is ideal for demonstrating how real-time data can be captured and displayed interactively.
